## Project Overview
>This repository aims to document the database design and development phases for the "FastBite" online food ordering and delivery application. The project covers the entire database design lifecycle, from initial requirements to the actual implementation of tables within the database.

## Tools and Technologies Used
> To effectively understand and contribute to this project, familiarity with the following tools and technologies is beneficial:

## Repository Contents

**This repository is organized to provide a comprehensive overview of various aspects of the database design:**

> 1. **docs/:**
*Contains official project documentation.*

**SRS_FastBite_App.docx**: The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the FastBite application, outlining the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.

> 2. **diagrams/:**
*Houses illustrative diagrams for the database design.*

**FastBite_ERD.png**: The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) representing the logical design of the FastBite database, showing entities and their relationships.
